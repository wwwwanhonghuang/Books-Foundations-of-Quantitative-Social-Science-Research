# Foundations of Quantitative Social Science Research

**Author:** Wanhong Huang **Date:** January 2026

## Overview

This repository contains the complete educational materials for a comprehensive textbook and course series on quantitative social science (QSS) research methodology. The materials bridge classical research design principles with modern computational approaches, emphasizing systematic thinking, methodological rigor, and reproducible research practices.

## Repository Structure

This project is organized to support a three-course sequence in quantitative social science research:

Topics include:

- Introduction to quantitative social science research
- Research design fundamentals
- Conceptualization and operationalization
- Classical experimental design
- Data collection methods and instruments
- Measurement theory and validity
- Sampling strategies

### Course 2: Foundations of QSS (Part 2)

**Focus:** Data Processing, Analysis, and Publication

Topics include:

- Data processing and management
- Statistical analysis techniques
- Data visualization and interpretation
- Results publication and dissemination
- Research contracts and ethics
- Reproducible research approaches
