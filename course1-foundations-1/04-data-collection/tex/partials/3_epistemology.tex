\section{Epistemology of Measurement and Data Quality}

Having established what we dataficate—entities and their associated states, 
processes, properties, relations, and events—and how these phenomena are 
represented in quantitative research, we now confront the epistemological 
question: how do we know that our measurements validly capture what we claim 
to measure? The transformation from lived phenomena to formal data is never 
transparent or innocent. Every measurement embeds theoretical commitments, 
every operationalization involves interpretive choices, every dataset reflects 
decisions about what to include and exclude. This section examines the 
epistemic foundations and quality criteria that distinguish rigorous 
quantitative social science from mere data collection.
