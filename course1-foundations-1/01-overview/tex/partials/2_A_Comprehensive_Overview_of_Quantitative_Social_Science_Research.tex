\section{A Comprehensive Overview of Quantitative Social Science Research}
\label{sec:overview}
\input{partials/2/overview_tikz_fig.tex}

This section provides a systematic overview of quantitative social science research to establish the foundational requirements for
 our computational framework. 
We begin by describing the general research lifecycle common to most quantitative studies, 
then detail the major research schemes employed in the field, followed by an examination of analytical methods and 
dissemination practices. Throughout, we identify computational support needs that inform our computational framework design.
